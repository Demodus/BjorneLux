# BjorneLux
Initial commit of the v1.1 map by Chesco

This is an attempt to make a few personal modifications to the BjorneLux map found at http://www.modhoster.de/mods/bjornelux

Wouldl ike to add the mod MapBuyableObject https://mod-portal.com/forum/filebase/index.php/Entry/555-MP-Map-Buyable-Object/
support for a number of ideas such as ramps and silo conveyors.
